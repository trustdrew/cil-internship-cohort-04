Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's
benefits in software development.

<p> Scrum: <br>
 Is a hands-on system consisting of simple interlocking steps and components.</p>
 <p>
 Here a developer meets with a client to discusss her company's needs.The needs discussed are the product backlog.The developer chooses the most important tasks to work on in the next two weeks known as a <i>sprint</i>.His team meets in a daily scrum to target work for the day ahead and address road blocks.At the end of the sprint, the developer delivers the work, reviews the backlog, and sets the goal for the next sprint.The cycle repeats until the software is complete

 <h3>Benefits of scrum in the software development process</h3>
 <ul>
 <li><b>Faster:</b>Speed is one of the biggest benefits of Scrum. A faster software development life cycle means less time between paying and getting paid. That, in turn, means a more profitable business.
 </li>
 <li><b>Increased customer satisfaction:</b>
 With Scrum, customers don’t wait for months or years, only to get exactly what they didn’t want. Instead, they get iterations of something very close to what they want, very fast. The system adjusts quickly to refine the successful customer solution, adapting as it goes to changes in the overall environment.
 </li>
 <li><b>Values employees:</b>
 Employees whose ideas are valued are vastly more productive than those who are ordered to follow a set of rules. Scrum respects employees by giving them the goal, then trusting them to reach it. Since they’re the ones with their hands on the controls and the ones who see the obstacles that crop up every day, employees are in the best position to respond to challenges and meet the goals at hand.
 </li>
 <li><b>Eliminates rework:</b>
 By involving the customer at more than just the phases of requirements and delivery, the project remains on-task and in-tune with customer needs at every step. This means less backtracking and less “out on a limb” time between the time we do the work and the time the customer suggests revisions.
 </li>
 </ul>
