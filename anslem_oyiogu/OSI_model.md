A layered process I am familiar with that is similar to the OSI model is the way online multiplayer games communicate with each other.e
APPLICATION LAYER: it is an application that opens what was sent or creates what is to be sent, e.g resource sharing, network management.  ( SMTP, DNS).
PRESENTATION LAYER: it encrypts and decrypts the data presented by the application layer if needed. E.g character code translation, data conversion (ASCII, EBCDCI)
SESSION LAYER: it synchronises and sends to ports,allowing session establishment between processes running on different stations. E.g Session establishment, Maintenance and termination. (SQL,RPC)
TRANSPORT LAYER: it ensures data between the two games are delivered error-free, in sequence, and with no losses or duplications.
NETWORK LAYER: it decides the physical path the data takes, while also controlling the operations of the subnet. E.g Routing, Subnet traffic control, subnet usage accounting (TCP, UDP)
DATA LINK LAYER: it provides error-free transfer of data frames from one node to another over the physical layer. E.g Establishes and terminates the logical link between nodes, frame traffic control, frame sequencing.(Switch Bridge WAP, PPP,SLIP)
PHYSICAL LAYER: it is concerned with the transmission and reception of the unstructured raw bit stream over the physical medium into the console. E.g Data Encoding, Physical medium attachment.
E.g Hub, Cables, router, Wifi.
